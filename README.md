# Hotdog-or-not
Simple "Hotdog or not!" javascript app made for testing the [ml5.js](https://github.com/ml5js) library
* [Check it working](http://hotdog-or-not.surge.sh) - Check it working here!

Hot dog or not! uses vanilla JavaScript, [ml5.js](https://github.com/ml5js) 0.1.0 for image detection and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 4.1.3 for styling

NOTE: WIP Bug: (This is fixed right now with a temporal and ugly patch, I need to find a definitive and "real" solution) Sometimes the app fails, it has something to do with the delay between loading the image and passing it to the image classifier, but i cannot find a solotion right now
